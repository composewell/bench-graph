An easy to use package to plot the benchmarking results generated by `gauge` or
`criterion`. You can translate the names of the benchmarks for better
presentation and you can filter which benchmarks you want on the plot, in what
order and on what scale.

You can compare the difference in benchmark results of different versions of
the same package or the difference between similar benchmarks of different
packages. Comparison between many benchmarks can be shown side by side as full
results of both, or as the difference from a baseline. TBD example pictures.

You can plot any of the fields available in `gauge` output, for example:

* time
* cycles
* total allocations (allocated)
* bytes copied during GC (bytesCopied)
* CPU time taken by the mutator i.e. other than GC (mutatorCpuSeconds)
* CPU time taken by the garbage collector (gcCpuSeconds)

And many others, including voluntary or involuntary context switches or max
resident set size (rss).
